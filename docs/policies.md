## Policies

### Lectures
Lectures are on Mondays (8-10 pm @ AAPB 115), except for common midterms (CS61ABC, 70, etc.) and holidays.

### Attendance
Attendance is mandatory. If you absolutely cannot make it to lecture, please DM any of the leads

Note that there are lecture quizzes due each week on Gradescope.

### Homeworks
Throughout the semester, we'll be releasing homeworks that accompany lectures. We'll also be hosting weekly **homework parties** so you can ask questions and work with your fellow new members on the homework.

### Paper presentations
Starting from week 4, a group of two will give a presentation on a given paper at the start of the week's lecture Please make sure to add your name to this
[signup sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b8OkElGwP0c5ZZPKoxf6n_3iSpcMFypX7O-oV90YWw8/edit?usp=sharing).

### Midterm
Halfway through instruction, you will have an oral midterm exam covering all topics that have been taught thus far. It will be carried out individually and will take about an hour.

### Final project
Towards the latter half of NMEP, you will complete a project of your choosing with the help of mentors (older ML@B members). Project teams will be **3-4 people**, and there will be a final project showcase at the end of the semester so you can talk about the ✨cool✨ things you've built/discovered!

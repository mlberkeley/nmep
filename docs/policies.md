## Policies

### Lectures
Lectures are on Mondays, 8-10 pm @ AAPB 115, except common midterms (CS61ABC, 70, etc.) and holidays.

### Attendance
Attendance is mandatory. If you absolutely cannot make it to lecture, please DM Sara or Saathvik.

Note that there is lecture quizzes due each week on Gradescope (join code: KDY57V).

### Homeworks
Throughout the semester, we'll be releasing homeworks that accompany lectures. To subvert limitless extensions, we'll be implementing a hard extension policy requiring you to turn in homework **at most 4 days after the deadline**. This policy is for your benefit and will help you keep pace with the course!

We'll also be hosting weekly **homework parties** so you can ask questions and work with your fellow new members on the homework. 

Homework parties are Fridays, 12pm-2pm (11am-12pm for those who can't make it) @ BWW Floor 3.

### Paper presentations
Starting from week 4, a group of two will present a given paper each week at the start of the lecture.

### Final
During the last week of instruction, you will have a final exam, covering all topics that have been taught through the semester. It will be carried out individually and will take about an hour, where you will be asked to answer questions orally.

### Final project
Towards the latter half of NMEP, you'll also be completing a project of your choosing with the help of mentors (older ML@B members). Project teams will be **3-4 people**, and there will be a final project showcase at the end of the semester so you can talk about the ✨cool✨ things you built/discovered!
